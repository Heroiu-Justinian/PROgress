# PROgress is a simple program that helps you keep track of how many lines of code you have added/deleted in a time period

# Usage:
python3 progress.py

After running this commmand you will be prompted to give a directory path

# Note: 
*The program will count the lines of code only in the specified directory and the directories that are direct children of the specified one

*It is currently working only with linux and the path you have to provide should be anything after /home/username/ as it gets this path as default



# IMPORTANT: 
the first run is an init run so the results have nothing to do with the real data




At the moment it is awful as it was coded in 2 hours and 45 minutes by a noob in python.
