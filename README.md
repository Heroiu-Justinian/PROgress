# PROgress is a simple program that keeps track of how many lines of code you have written since the last time have run the script

Using it is trivial: run progress.py and provide the program with the path to the directory in which you want it to run(it will only track lines for the directory whose path it was given by you, it can't currently traverse directories)


It is currently working only with linux and the path you have to provide should be anything after /home/username/ as it gets this path as default




IMPORTANT: the first run is an init run so the results have nothing to do with the real data




At the moment it is awful as it was coded in 2 hours by a noob in python.
