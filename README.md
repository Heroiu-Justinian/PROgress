# PROgress is a simple program that helps you keep track of how many lines of code you have added/deleted in a time period

In addition to that it lets you know if you don't use enough comments in your code(if the ratio between the comments and the actual lines of code is less than 1:30)
Note:the comment feature it only works with python comments I have already spent almost 3 hours on this and I am bored so I don't think I'll make it work for other languages as well.

# Prerequisites
modules : os,glob,time,math
python version : python3.x.x


# Usage:
python3 progress.py

After running this commmand you will be prompted to give a directory path

# Note: 
*The program will count the lines of code only in the specified directory and the directories that are direct children of the specified one

*It is currently working only with linux and the path you have to provide should be anything after /home/username/ as it gets this path as default

*It works with python, c, c++, javascript, css and html.



# IMPORTANT: 
the first run is an init run so the results have nothing to do with the real data



I got bored of it so I don't think I'll add much to it but it is a fun little micro-project
