# PROgress is a simple program that keeps track of how many lines of code you have written since the last time have run the script

Using it is trivial: run progress.py and provide the program with the path to the directory in which you want it to run(it will only track lines for the directory whose path it was given by you, it can't currently traverse directories)


It is currently working only with linux and the path you have to provide should be anything after /home/username/ as it gets this path as default
